I am an evolutionary biologist and population geneticist based at Uppsala University in Sweden. Using next generation sequencing techniques, I study the genetic basis of local adaptation in non-model species (ü¶ú + üêü). My research interests predominantly centre around understanding how populations respond to environmental change, with a particular interest in the changes that take place during the first few generations following the colonisation of new environments.
